## Description
The Vaccine Dose Verification System with Blockchain is a solution designed to facilitate vaccine dose verifications between countries using blockchain technology. 
This innovative system ensures the integrity and security of vaccine certificates while enabling seamless verification processes. 
The project integrates Java applets for backend functionality, utilizing Java code, MySQL, and MongoDB databases. The system is accessible via a user-friendly web application, compatible with both desktop monitors and mobile devices.

### Key Features
- Blockchain Implementation: Utilizes blockchain technology to create a secure and transparent platform for vaccine dose verifications.
- Cross-Country Verification: Enables efficient verification of vaccine doses across multiple countries and participants.
- Java Applets: Employs Java applets for robust backend functionality, ensuring data integrity and reliability.
- Database Integration: Utilizes MySQL and MongoDB databases to store and manage people's details, vaccine doses, and other relevant information.
- Web Application: Features a responsive web application interface that is accessible on both desktop monitors and mobile screens, providing a seamless user experience.

### How It Works
- The system operates as a decentralized network, allowing participating countries to verify vaccine doses and certificates. Here's how it works:
- User Registration: Individuals register on the platform, providing necessary details including their personal information and vaccine doses received.
- Data Encryption: User data is encrypted and stored securely in the MySQL and MongoDB databases, ensuring confidentiality and data integrity.
- Blockchain Verification: Vaccine certificates and dose information are stored on the blockchain, creating an immutable record. Participants can verify the authenticity of vaccine certificates by checking the blockchain entries.
- Cross-Country Verification: Participating countries can verify vaccine doses administered to individuals from other countries, fostering international collaboration and trust.

### System Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK).
- MySQL Database.
- MongoDB Database.
- Web Browser (for accessing the web application).
- Web server
